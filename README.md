# Magic: the Gathering Mana Calculator

#### Clojure Independent Study Project - 5/19/2016

#### By Anna Lawley

## Description

This app is an exercise in building an app with Clojure and ClojureScript. It's a simple tool for Magic: the Gathering players to enter the number of resources their decks will need to function as well as how many resource cards the deck will be running, and the page will then calculate a distribution of resource cards by type (Players list total mana symbols by color and how many basic lands the deck wants, and the page returns a listing of basic lands by type with a recommended count).
